# Engine Architecture

This page explains the engine as a set of connected subsystems rather than as isolated files

## 1. Entry Point And Startup

The main executable starts in `src/main.cpp`

```cpp
quill::Backend::start();
quill::Frontend::create_or_get_logger("sdl", console_sink);
SDL_Manager* sdl_ptr = nullptr;
sdl_ptr = &SDL_Manager::sdl();
initialize();
```

Source: `src/main.cpp:879-899`

This startup sequence establishes four things immediately

- logging exists before the engine starts doing work
- SDL is initialized through the singleton `SDL_Manager`
- the user hook `initialize()` is called
- the rest of the engine can assume there is a valid runtime environment

The user hook is intentionally tiny right now

```cpp
void initialize() {
    // objective A boot hook for future scene setup
}
```

Source: `src/AppLayer.cpp:6-8`

That means the current engine is still framework-first rather than gameplay-first

## 2. Public Engine API Layer

The public API is intentionally narrow and lives in `src/Engine.h` and `src/Engine.cpp`

Its job is not to implement systems itself

Its job is to expose a clean API over the lower-level utility state and object storage

Example

```cpp
std::uint64_t getDeltaTime() {
    return utility::deltaTimeMs();
}

float getDeltaSeconds() {
    return utility::deltaSeconds();
}
```

Source: `src/Engine.cpp:9-15`

And object spawning is just a thin wrapper over `RtsUnit` creation

```cpp
auto object = std::make_unique<RtsUnit>(render_element, position, linear_velocity, angular_velocity);
return utility::addGameObject(std::move(object)) > 0;
```

Source: `src/Engine.cpp:17-23`

So architecturally the `Engine` layer is a facade

## 3. Runtime State Layer

The real mutable runtime state lives in `src/Utility.cpp`

It stores

- frame delta in milliseconds
- frame delta in seconds
- the vector of active `GameObject` instances

This is the central state bridge between the main loop and the simulation

The important consequence is that `src/main.cpp` calculates time, then the engine stores it once, and all later update code reads from the same source of truth

## 4. Object System

The base type is `GameObject`

```cpp
class GameObject {
public:
    virtual ~GameObject() = default;
    virtual void update(float delta_seconds) = 0;
    glm::mat4 getModel() const;
```

Source: `src/GameObject.h`

This tells you the core object model

- objects are polymorphic
- each object advances itself per frame
- each object can produce a model matrix for rendering

The current concrete object is `RtsUnit`

```cpp
void RtsUnit::update(float delta_seconds) {
    integrateVelocity(delta_seconds);
    integrateAngularVelocity(delta_seconds);
}
```

Source: `src/RtsUnit.cpp:11-14`

So the current simulation model is intentionally simple

- linear velocity updates position
- angular velocity updates orientation

## 5. Transform And Spatial Layer

The file pair `src/SceneGraph.h` and `src/SceneGraph.cpp` is one of the most important architectural pieces

It does two separate jobs

1. parent-child transform propagation
2. BVH-based spatial indexing

The class comment explains the intent directly

```cpp
 * 1. keep a parent-child transform tree so child nodes inherit parent motion
 * 2. build a bounding volume hierarchy over active object nodes for broad spatial queries
```

Source: `src/SceneGraph.h`

This distinction matters

- the transform tree answers "where is this object in world space after inheritance"
- the BVH answers "which objects are worth testing or rendering in this region"

The per-frame integration point is here

```cpp
scene_graph.setLocalTransformByObject(item.window_id,
                                      getModelForRenderElement(item.window_id));
scene_graph.updateWorldTransforms();
scene_graph.rebuildSpatialIndex();
```

Source: `src/main.cpp:500-510`

That three-step sequence is the center of the engine

## 6. Rendering Layer

Rendering is distributed across several files with very clear roles

- `MeshDiscovery`
  Finds candidate mesh files on disk
- `MeshLoader`
  Parses `.meshbin`
- `Shape`
  Owns CPU-side mesh arrays plus OpenGL VAO and VBO handles
- `ShaderProgram`
  Compiles and links GLSL
- `Texture2D`
  Loads BMP textures or creates a checker fallback
- `Renderer3D`
  Queues and submits draw commands

The renderer itself is intentionally small

```cpp
for (const RenderCommand& command : queue_) {
    glBindVertexArray(command.shape->getVAO());
    glUniformMatrix4fv(proj_uniform_loc_, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(command.projection));
    glUniformMatrix4fv(view_uniform_loc_, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(command.view));
    glUniformMatrix4fv(model_uniform_loc_, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(command.model));
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, command.shape->getVertexCount());
}
```

Source: `src/Renderer3D.cpp:69-88`

So the renderer is queue-based, but still deliberately straightforward

## 7. Window And Context Layer

`src/SDL_Manager.cpp` owns SDL lifecycle and all OpenGL contexts

Important design decisions

- it is a singleton
- each window gets its own OpenGL context
- the first window acts like the main window for quitting

Context creation happens here

```cpp
SDL_Window *window =
    SDL_CreateWindow(title.c_str(), x, y, width, height, flags);
SDL_GLContext context = SDL_GL_CreateContext(window);
SDL_GL_MakeCurrent(window, context)
```

Source: `src/SDL_Manager.cpp:157-185`

That design is what enables the multi-window mesh viewer in the main executable

## 8. Audio Layer

Audio uses SDL's callback model instead of a polling model

The callback bridge is explicit

```cpp
void sound_callback(void* userdata, Uint8* stream, int len) {
    auto* sound_system = static_cast<SoundSystem*>(userdata);
    sound_system->mixToStream(stream, len);
}
```

Source: `src/SoundSystem.cpp:22-28`

Architecturally this means

- sounds are preloaded or loaded on demand
- playback requests are queued
- the audio device thread pulls data through the callback

## 9. Demo Layer

The Doom-style demo in `demo/DoomDemo.cpp` is not a separate engine

It is a concrete example of using the same core pieces

- SDL window creation
- renderer setup
- `SceneGraph`
- mesh loading
- sound playback
- gameplay state

That is useful because it shows how the engine modules are expected to be composed by future game code

## 10. Architectural Summary

If you need to explain the engine in one paragraph, say this

> The project is organized as a small engine facade over global runtime state, a polymorphic object layer, a transform tree plus BVH spatial layer, an OpenGL rendering stack, SDL window and context management, and an SDL callback audio system. The main loop computes delta time, updates game objects, synchronizes world transforms into the scene graph, rebuilds the BVH, renders visible objects, and swaps the windows.
